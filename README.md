# Project Title

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

***

## Cooperation Plan
Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.
### Describe at least:
What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
- Marco knows how to code. 
- Dylan is a ChatGPT expert.
- Writing and editing is Deontae's strength.
- Nicholas can research issues for positive results.

### How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?

- Marco will take lead with all coding and scripting, we will assist in whatever he can’t accomplish using Dylan’s ChatGPT skills. Deontae will fine-tune our SOP with input from the group while utilizing Nick's google research skills. 
### In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?
- Nicholas and Deontae want to become proficient coders.
- Marco wants to get better at professional communication and better technical writring.
- Dylan wants to develop an overall technical proficiency.

### Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
- We will work as a team on all aspects of the lab, but each of us will have to focus on our individual responsibilities. We will start our day with a friendly discussion about the tasks ahead and get into working on our project after the discussion. 

## Conflict Plan

Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.
Describe at least:

### What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

- We will take a 15-20 break to reassess what the conflict is, how it affects us, and how we can each propose a solution to the issue. If necessary, an outside mediator can be utilized for continuing issues.

### What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute? 

- Open flow of communication to the offending party. Express concerns and remediate. Adapt and overcome. 

### How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

- we will use Slack to keep good communication. 
    We are as strong as our weakest link and will communicate on the level of the weakest link.

### How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

- Use the same method as a team member that is taking charge. Effective communication. Set clear expectations.

### How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful? 

- We would choose to reach out to an instructor to mediate the issues we have among the group if, and only if, we run into the same issue 2-3 times.

## Communication Plan

Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.
Describe at least:

### What hours will you be available to communicate?

- Marco: 6am - 9pm
- Deontae: 07:30-9pm (Texting is always better)
- Nicholas: 0900-1800 (Messaging always available)
- Dylan: Always on call baby

### What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
- Slack will be our primary communication method
- Text
- Zoom
- Remo
- Trello

### How often will you take breaks?
- 15 minutes per hour

### What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

- We will put in extra hours to make sure we keep on schedule
    Depending on what the issue is, we will all coordinate together with the person who is falling behind.

### How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?

- ***Dylan Dempsey***
    * (304) 654-3151
- ***Marco*** 
    * (912)414-1765
- ***Deontae***
    * (562) 253-2719
- ***Nicholas Loiacono***
    * (951) 529-6397

### What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?

- If any issues come up we will bring them up to the team to discuss it.

### How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?

- We will treat each member with kindness and respect to invoke an environment where everyone wants to speak and listen.

## Work Plan

Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.

### Describe at least:

## How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?

- We will all agree on whatever needs to be done. 

## What project management tool will be used?

- We will be using Trello to track tickets and workflow.


## Presentation Deck

- Check out [Team Awesome Presentation Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mmS3iLv_nZDtye8p0x4w83COf2qh0HYrBYZSCriivhA/edit).

## Schedule your practice session

Work with your instructor to pre-schedule an date and time for your “practice run” of your presentation. This should either be an exact time, or a short window of time designated by your instructor. Plan for a 30-45 minute meeting during the class session before your actual presentation to allow time for both your practice run and feedback from the instructional team.

Reminder as you work on and practice your presentations:

* Expressions of gratitude should be heartfelt.
* Team members should make strong eye contact with the             “audience” / camera when not presenting.
* Be positive, no matter how tired or burned out you may feel … “Your smiles can be heard over the phone.”

## Git Process

Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.
Describe at least:

## What components of your project will live on GitHub?

- For now, our README.md file will be stored on GitHub. If any additional coding is needed for the project, we will create another file to utilize for the project.

## How will you share the repository with your teammates?

- Trello.com

## What is your Git flow?

- We will create branches, and Marco will be in charge of ACP to Github.

## Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider the following:
* How many people must review a PR?

- Until we become better versed in Pull Request (PR) review workflow, we will not be utilizing this function. 

## Who merges PRs?

- Marco will be in charge of merging branches.

## How often will you merge?

- At the end of a completed task. 

## How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?

- Team agreement.
